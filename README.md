# Railway Ticket Booking and Management System

## Description

Develop a C# console application for a Railway Ticket Booking and Management System. The application will allow users to book, manage, and view railway tickets for different destinations, manage train schedules, and handle ticket-related tasks efficiently. The system should also be designed for potential extensibility to a graphical user interface (GUI).

## UI Design

The console application will provide a user-friendly text-based interface. Users can interact with the system by typing commands and providing necessary information.

## Features

1.  **Ticket Booking:**
    
    -   Users can search for available trains based on source and destination stations, and view their schedules.
    -   Users can book tickets by selecting a train, specifying the number of passengers, and providing passenger details.
    -   The system should handle seat availability and assign seats to passengers.
2.  **Ticket Management:**
    
    -   Users can view their booked tickets, including details like train number, source, destination, departure time, and seat numbers.
    -   Users can cancel booked tickets, and the system should update seat availability accordingly.
3.  **Train Management:**
    
    -   Admin users can add new trains to the system by providing train details such as train number, source, destination, and schedule.
    -   Admin users can update train schedules, modify train details, or remove trains from the system.
4.  **View Train Schedule:**
    
    -   Users can view the schedule of a specific train, including all stops and departure times.
5.  **Search and Filter:**
    
    -   Users can search for trains by source, destination, or a specific date.
    -   Users can filter search results based on various criteria, such as departure time or train type.

## Functional Requirements

1.  User Registration and Login:
    
    -   Users need to register and log in to book tickets.
    -   Test cases: Verify user registration, login, and authentication process.
2.  Ticket Booking and Availability:
    
    -   Users should be able to book tickets only if seats are available.
    -   Test cases: Check seat availability, successful ticket booking, and handling of fully booked trains.
3.  Ticket Cancellation:
    
    -   Users should be able to cancel tickets and receive appropriate refunds.
    -   Test cases: Cancel a booked ticket and ensure seat availability and refund calculations.
4.  Train Management:
    
    -   Admin users should be able to add, update, and remove trains.
    -   Test cases: Add a new train, update train schedule, and remove a train.
5.  Search and Filter:
    
    -   Test cases: Search for trains by different criteria and validate search results.

## Non-Functional Requirements

1.  **Performance:**
    
    -   The system should handle multiple concurrent users and provide quick responses.
    -   Test cases: Simulate concurrent user requests and measure response times.
2.  **Usability:**
    
    -   The UI should be intuitive and easy to use.
    -   Test cases: Conduct user tests to ensure a smooth and efficient user experience.
3.  **Reliability:**
    
    -   The system should handle errors gracefully and recover from failures.
    -   Test cases: Introduce errors and exceptions to test error handling and recovery mechanisms.
4.  **Security:**
    
    -   User data, including passwords, should be securely stored and transmitted.
    -   Test cases: Validate data encryption, authentication, and authorization processes.
5.  **Scalability:**
    
    -   The system should be designed to accommodate future growth in terms of users and data.
    -   Test cases: Simulate increased user load and monitor system performance.
6.  **Extensibility to Graphical UI:**
    
    -   The application architecture should be designed with modularity and separation of concerns in mind, allowing for easy integration of a graphical user interface (GUI) in the future.
    -   Test cases: Create a basic graphical UI prototype that interacts with the existing system components.
